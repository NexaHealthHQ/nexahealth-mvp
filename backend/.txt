Core Responsibilities

1. Drug Verification API

Input: Drug name + NAFDAC code from frontend.

Logic:

Check against a mock database (JSON, or MongoDB) of drug entries:

verified: Show green status

flagged: Show red (if multiple reports exist)

unknown: Show yellow



Output: JSON response with status (verified/unverified/flagged) and message.


2. Suspicious Drug Report Submission

Accept:

Drug name

Optional NAFDAC code

Pharmacy name

Text description

Image upload (optional)

Location (lat, lng)

Timestamp (auto)


Store in MongoDB or Firebase Firestore under a reports collection.

Track how many reports a specific pharmacy has received.


3. Map Endpoint for Flagged Pharmacies

Logic: If a pharmacy has 3 or more reports, mark it as "flagged".

Output: GeoJSON or structured data for frontend map (Leaflet/Google Maps).

[
  {
    "pharmacy": "HopeMed Ikeja",
    "location": { "lat": 6.603, "lng": 3.351 },
    "report_count": 6,
    "drug": "Coartem"
  }
]


4. Connect to ML Risk Classifier

Expose an endpoint like /predict-risk:

Input: JSON with text description

Output: risk: Low | Medium | High



Integrate the locally trained model from the ML teammate (via joblib or shared function).


5. Nearby Health & Pharmacy Suggestions
Option: Use Google Places API if time and internet access permit.

Create endpoint like /get-nearby?lat=...&lng=...



---

Optional Extras (if time permits)

Admin endpoint to view all reports or download CSV

Simple authentication layer (not required for MVP)

Enable CORS for frontend/ML model integration
